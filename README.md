# nextjs-test

### Installation guide 

cd nextjs-test,
npm i to install all deps,
npm run dev to start the application

### Deployment

### Link: https://nextjs-test-kohl-delta.vercel.app/

### Decisions

Decided to use Typescript to have strict typing

### Assumptions

I've decided to include only breadcrumbs in the header along side logo since we don't have many pages to include a menu, product details breadcrumb is only visible on product details page

### Time spent 

3-3.5 hrs
