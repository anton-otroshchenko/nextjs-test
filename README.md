# nextjs-test

### Installation guide 

cd nextjs-test,
npm i to install all deps,
npm run dev to start the application

### Deployment

### Link: https://nextjs-test-kohl-delta.vercel.app/

### Decisions

Decided to use Typescript to have strict typing
Decided to include DockerFile but not use in the deployment process since its faster and easier to deploy it in Vercel directly

### Assumptions

I've decided to include only breadcrumbs in the header along side logo since we don't have many pages to include a menu, product details breadcrumb is only visible on product details page

### Time spent 

3-3.5 hrs
